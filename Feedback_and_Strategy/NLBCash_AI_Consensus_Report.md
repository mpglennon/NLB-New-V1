# NLB Cash — AI Consensus Report (Convergence)

**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Reviewers:** DeepSeek V3, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Perplexity Pro  
**Verdict:** GO (High Confidence)

---

## 1. The Verdict: "Financial Weather Forecasting"

The consensus is unanimous: **The philosophy is the product.**

*   **Old Way:** Financial Forensic Accounting (YNAB/Mint). Looking back, categorization, guilt.
*   **New Way (NLBCash):** Financial Weather Forecasting. Looking forward, runway, sleeping at night.

> *"Most apps treat $0 as the failure state. Your app treats the date of $0 as a moving target you can control. This makes the user feel like a pilot, not a defendant in court."* — Perplexity

## 2. Strengths (Keep These)

1.  **Runway vs. Balance:** The shift from "$10,000 balance" to "90 Days Runway" is the killer feature. Time is the currency of the freelancer.
2.  **Visuals:** Dark mode, high contrast, and "funded startup" polish validation. It looks pro.
3.  **Friction-as-Feature:** Manual entry is accepted as a "consciousness" tool, not a bug.
4.  **Sleep-at-Night Lines:** The red/orange threshold lines on the chart are the exact "Am I okay?" indicator users need.

## 3. The Weaknesses (Fix These)

1.  **Mobile Gap (Critical):** The desktop-first design is a barrier for the "coffee shop check-in." **Must fix.**
2.  **Setup Friction:** The daily 30-second promise is great, but the *first 30 minutes* (setup) looks daunting. Need to automate baseline recurring items.
3.  **Trust Signal:** Users love no-link, but need reassurance. Explicitly state "Data stays on device / Local Storage."

## 4. Feature Ideas (Power Tier)

*   **"What If" Simulator:** A slider to test purchases ("If I buy this laptop, runway drops to 45 days").
*   **Template Transactions:** "Repeat Last" button to speed up manual entry.
*   **Days > Dollars:** Make the "Days of Runway" number visually larger than the bank balance.

## 5. Strategic Direction

**Marketing:** Position as an **Anti-Anxiety Tool**, not a budgeting app. Target YNAB refugees.
**Mobile:** PWA (Progressive Web App) is the right path. Fast, no App Store friction, installable immediately.
**Pricing:** $49.99 Launch Tier confirmed. $79.99 Power Tier (with "What If" simulator) later.
