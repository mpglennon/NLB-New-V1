**Prompt for 4.6:**

Write onboarding microcopy for NLBCash, a personal finance app focused on forward-looking cash flow (not historical budgeting). The app is built around the "30/30 Method" (30 minutes to set up, 30 seconds daily to maintain) and the "Never Look Back" philosophy—no guilt, no reconciliation theater, just clarity on your runway.

**Brand positioning:**

- Part of PITM Apps (Punch In The Mouth Apps)—anti-establishment, contrarian, built for real people
- Tagline: "Life, not lattes"—focus on the big levers, not micro-optimization
- One account only (primary checking = command center)
- Founder is a former Fortune 100 exec, startup CEO, currently on a tight runway
- Team includes a senior on pension, middle manager on severance, and executives who've managed billion-dollar projects
- Core thesis: Daily snapshots beat sporadic deep dives. Consistency is rigor.

**Tone:**

- Conversational, confident, slightly cheeky (PITM energy)
- No corporate stiffness, no moralizing, no guilt language
- Validate the user: "You're not avoiding the work—you're doing the work that matters"
- Warm but not cutesy. Professional but not stuffy.

**Screens to write:**

1. **Intro Screen (Before Step 1):** Brief founder/team story + philosophy. Establish credibility and differentiation. (~100 words)
2. **Step 1: "What's in your account right now?"** Current checking balance entry. Explain why precision matters without being preachy. (~30 words)
3. **Step 2: "Let's start with what's coming in."** Income entry. Most people have 2-4 sources. Start with the main one. (~25 words)
4. **Step 3: "Now the big levers."** Expense entry. Focus on rent, car, groceries, insurance—the 80% that matters. Don't track the coffee. (~30 words)
5. **Setup Complete (Before Dashboard):** Celebrate completion. Reinforce 30 seconds daily (or longer by choice). Validate that daily snapshots = discipline, not laziness. Permission to use it however they want. (~80 words)

**Avoid:**

- Words like "honest," "lazy," "maybe money"—implies user dishonesty
- Redundant phrases like "liquid cash" (cash is already liquid)
- Moralizing or accusatory language
- Over-explaining features (keep it punchy)

**Key phrases to include somewhere:**

- "This isn't the shortcut. It's the smart way."
- "Consistent daily snapshots beat sporadic deep dives."
- "Life's complex enough. Your daily finance app shouldn't be."
- "Everything else is noise." (re: one-account philosophy)
- "Manage the big levers, and the lattes will take care of themselves."

Write tight, conversational copy that feels like a founder talking to a user over a beer, not a product manager writing help docs.
