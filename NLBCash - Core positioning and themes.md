- **Primary audience:** students, pensioners, gig/contract workers, people on severance,  consultants with lumpy/declining income who want to know “Am I okay for  the next 30–90 days?” without complexity.
- **Secondary audience (latent):** CEOs and high‑net‑worth operators who already have deeper tools/spreadsheets but want a **simple, forward‑looking daily driver** for cash.
- **Thesis:** One main cash account as the **Cash Flow Command Center**; everything is about forward‑looking cash runway and stress reduction, not full net‑worth accounting.
- **Ethos:** “Simple doesn’t mean unsophisticated.” It’s a **GTD‑style system for cash**, not a finance textbook.

## NLBCash Method: the 30/30 one‑account system

You can present this as bullets in onboarding/landing:

- One **primary chequing account** is your command center.
- **30 minutes to set up:**
  - Pick that account (or define it manually).
  - Enter core income and bills.
  - Drop them onto the Cash Calendar.
- **30 seconds a day to stay ahead:**
  - Glance at your runway (30 / 60 / 90 days).
  - Drag a few items if the calendar feels tight.
  - Notice “ETF time” moments when cash piles up.
- You can keep more powerful tools (investing app, spreadsheets, tax software) in your stack; **NLBCash is the daily driver on top.**
